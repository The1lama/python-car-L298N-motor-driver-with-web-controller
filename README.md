# python car with flask
This was a school project for controlling a car with pyhton using html/flask, and now I'm putting the code online.

How I have devided up the project is in `web-site` where I have put in the raw html file if you wanted to look closer to the file how it is built up. In the `motor movment` I have the code for the motors, one has the controlls in the terminal, the other is combined with the html and flask to controll the car. Lastly in the `finished version` the whole project is combined to just CTRL + C , CTRL + V.

Some pakeges you will have to install for this code will work
- **Flask**
- Have a **GPIO** installed

## Things needed to be able to build the car
- Raspberry pi
- L298N motor driver
- 12V DC Motor (2)
- 9 - 12 power supply
- cabels
- platform for car
- **Flask** installed to raspberry
- Have **GPIO** installed
